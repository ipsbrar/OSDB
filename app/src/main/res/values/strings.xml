        Goodell to either reverse the games result or reschedule the game from the point of the no-call – or replay the
        game in its entirety. The league recently said that replaying the game would have been prohibitively costly.
        Goodell insisted that changing the rules to allow penalties or adding an eight official to crews would only
        create more challenges. He acknowledged that expanding instant replay technology was a possibility, but
        qualified that it would not cover judgment calls.
